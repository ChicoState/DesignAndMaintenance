The implementation of builder  discussed in the Construction Management example demonstrates the Builder pattern.<br>

    * The example considered here is about the construction of houses of different design specifications via different clients.<br>

    * We have the entire construction code in the main builder class and for each design we have different classes ConcreteBuilder1,ConcreteBuilder2, ConcreteBuilder3.<br>

    *  Each of these classes will only inherit functions of their requirements from the main builder class. <br>

    * The builder pattern suggests that we select the object construction code out of its own class and move it to seperate classes called concrete builders.<br>

 The implemented code for builder can be found [here](builder.rb)
