The implementation of factory method discussed in the Gym Membership example demonstrates the Factory method pattern. <br>
* The factory method pattern implies that we replace direct object construction calls with specific factory method. <br>
* Objects are still created via new opetator. but, they are being called within the factory method. Factory method returns the finished priducts.
* we have a common interface Members. Each of the factory method returns different types of members and these members have their basis from interface class. <br>

The implemented code for factory method can be found [here](factory.rb) <br>
