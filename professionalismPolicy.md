Just in life, there is no extra credit. However, there are opportunities to either make up for small mistakes or magnify them.

By demonstrating outstanding work, every student has the opportunity to have poor grades forgiven (exempt from grade calculation, as a 0 out of 0).

Outstanding Work Credit (OWC) is awarded at the instructor's discretion to acknowledge work that demonstrates critical thinking and/or hard work.

OWC may be awarded for excellent questions, volunteering, or otherwise going above and beyond. For each OWC earned, at the end of the semester that student's 
lowest exercise grade will be dropped. For example, if three OWC have been earned, the three lowest grades will be dropped.

On the other hand, Preschool Marks (PM) are also given at the instructor's discretion to formally acknowledge when a student does not live up to expectations.
 For example, PM may be given for repeatedly showing up late to class, forgetting required materials, distracting yourself or others with phone use, or otherwise demonstrating irresponsibility;
  in other words, acting more like a preschooler than a responsible college student. Each PM cancels out an OWC. A net negative of OWC-PM results in dropping the student's highest exercise grades.

Additionally, in accordance with university rules, the instructor reserves the right to drop a student from the class if they miss more than two class meetings without notifying the instructor of a
 valid excuse (such as health or family emergencies) before the meeting (or as soon as possible when unanticipated emergencies arise).
