* Here, the IT Support System serves all the Departments across the entire university.
* It acts as the Facade system that decreases the overall complexity which the Departments are facing technically. <br>
* It helps get rid of the unwanted dependencies across all the Departments on campus. <br>
* All the Departments and their sub teams reach out to the IT Support System's Tier1 and Tier2 to get their technical complexities solved. <br>
