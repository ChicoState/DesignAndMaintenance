# Singleton

The Singleton is a creational design pattern that is used when there needs to be a class with exactly one instance of itself. This class can keep track of its own instance and make sure that no other instances are created. This is accomplished with a global access point -- the constructor is protected, and clients can only access the class through a member function. The Singleton pattern is relatively straightforward and easy to use; however, it can lead to less modular code, and should only be used in cases where a single instance of a class is actually required. A practical use of the Singleton pattern could be the inventory for a company that makes one item. Many clients may make (potentially simultaneous) transactions with the inventory, and it is important that the inventory be shared, so that someone who purchases the item can be sure that the item is actually available.
