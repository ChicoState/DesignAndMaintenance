# Mediator 

Mediator Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern which allows us to reduce the unordered dependencies between the objects. In a mediator environment, objects take the help of mediator objects to communicate with each other. It reduces coupling by reducing the dependencies between communicating objects. The mediator works as a router between objects and it can have itâ€™s own logic to provide a way of communication.
