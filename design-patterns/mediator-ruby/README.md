The implementation of Mediator discussed in the Remote Communication example demonstrates the Mediator pattern.<br>
* This pattern helps maintain the reduced dependency between components.<br>
* In difficult situations, where other components cannot properly interact with each mediator comes into picture.<br>
* We are considering an example of a transciever in a battlefield which helps soldiers Communicate with each other.<br>
* The soldiers are loosely coupled components that are independent and only directly depend on the transciever to help them communicate with each other.<br>
