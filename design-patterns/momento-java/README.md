# Momento Design Pattern
Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.
Memento pattern uses three actor classes. Memento contains state of an object to be restored. Originator creates and stores states in Memento objects and Caretaker object is responsible to restore object state from Memento. We have created classes Memento, Originator and CareTaker.
